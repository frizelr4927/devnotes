## Features
- __Tiny:__ weighing `4kb`, DevNotes is nothing compared to the other notes applications.
- __Useful:__ DevNotes has `syntax` highlighting.
- __Sync:__ Able to `sync` across platforms

## Philosophy
I heavily disliked most notes applications, they often lacked a sync between computers or were too bloated. I wanted a new notes program that just takes notes, not a gazillion other features that I won't use. So I made this.


## Installation
Download the latest release or compile from sources.
